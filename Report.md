Milestone 3 report

  This has been a great learning experience, in all my coding classes from 3 different school’s this was a 
fun challenging and possible goal we have set for us and was nothing less than satisfying and rewarding 
to complete. I had WAY too many setbacks on this project, from my github app not communicating well with 
my browser version and not saving any of my progress from Milestone 1. To then have constant 404’s during 
Milestone 2. Even though I didn’t get the final grade I was looking for in this I feel extremely rewarded 
in figuring it out with a lot of help from friends but still finished. I think across 3 different computers 
I created and restarted well over 5 repositories finally having it fully functioning and working by the final 
draft. 

  One thing that was great to learn in this class was the use of classes and files, in my past classes we would 
do some in depth work on calling classes and files but this was so focused on every file working together that 
it definitely showed the importance of attention to detail in this major/career. I tried to put the most amount 
of said attention into the overall user experience of the website especially on different platforms having both 
tablet and mobile media settings to best suit where this might be opened. 
Tablet: 
@media (max-width: 1024px) {
    main {
        padding: 1.5rem;
        margin: 1.5rem;
    }
    
    h1 {
        font-size: 2.2rem;
    }
}
Phones:
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Mobile-specific styles */
    nav ul {
        flex-direction: column;
        position: absolute;
        top: 100%;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;
    }
    
    h1 {
        font-size: 1.8rem;
    }
}

(unfortantly due to the constant new repositories I have no testing on this file because all of these lines came from 
a repository on my work computer)
