    <h1>Key Concepts for Browsers</h1>
    <p>
      What is a Browser: A browser is essentially a portal connecting users across the world
      to the internet where we store a vast array of information, forms, and others tools for others. 
      With this very wide topic alot of terms and ideas will be said throughout this, and this
      page will be the intro into having a better concept of what this website it for. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Rendering Engine</h2>
    <p>
      The "Rendering Engine" is how the website, or browser communicates with the Operating System
      (OS) to complete and compile requests for dispalying differnt things on a user's screen. Think
      of it as the brain and blood of the computer. The OS is responisble for almost every function of 
      a computer either voluntary or involuntary. 
    </p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h3>Popular Rendering Engines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>UI:</strong> How a user can interact and use a browser or website</li>
        <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> The process of compiling code within pages and displaying it</li>
        <li><strong>Networks :</strong> For the management in processing HTTP, and HTTPS requests</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>HTTP and HTTPS Protocols</h2>
    <p>
      HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure(HTTPS) are two 
      protocols that our browser and network are responsible for in the transfering of data. 
      HTTP is the more basic process used in trasfering smaller less important bits of data. 
      HTTPS encrypts the HTTP file increasing the security of the user attempting to share data 
      and do it safely. 
    </p>
    <h2>Major Browser Components</h2>
    <p>
     Browsers are responsbile for a VAST list of tasks, all required to work together near
     instantly to provide the best experience on the Web. A short list of jobs our browsers 
      are responsible of keeping track of are the following:
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Job</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>User Interface</td>
          <td>These are visual and intractable asepcts within a website</td>
          <td>Nav bar located above ^</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Browser Engine</td>
          <td>Gets the UI and rendering engine to work together</td>
          <td>Handles user input and queries the rendering engine</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Rendering </td>
          <td>Compiles and displays the code within websites and browsers</td>
          <td>Everything you see within the website was done via rendering </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Networking</td>
          <td>Process HTTP and HTTPS requests often time multiple at once</td>
          <td>opening web pages, images, and other resources</td>
        </tr>
       
        <tr>
          <td>Data Storage</td>
          <td>Stores data locally (cookies, cache)</td>
          <td>Browser history, and website passwords</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="image-caption">The DOM represents web pages as a tree structure of objects</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Cache</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are bits of data that your computer will store to make the overall experience
      better for a user. These bits of data could be something like login passwords & user's,
      or a shopping cart your working on. It is a more user focused version of a cashe, which
      is focused more on the overall speed and efficency of the browser. Within the cashe 
      a browser will store thinkgs like the next page of a website, images or files that have 
      a possiblity of being opened in the near future. 
    </p>

  
    <h2>Browser Standards</h2>
    <p>
     Due to the amount of browsers out there, it is important for everyone to have a standard 
     they have to adhere too. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>World Wide Web Consortium:</strong> Standard for accessibility</li>
      <li><strong>WHATWG:</strong> Maintaince the HTML standards</li>
      <li><strong>Internet Engineering Task Force:</strong> Sets HTTP, and HTTPS protocol</li>
      <li><strong>ECMA International:</strong> Standarizes use of JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="success-box">
      <h3>Best Practice</h3>
      <p>
        Always keep your browser updated to the latest version. Browser updates often include 
        critical security patches that protect you from newly discovered vulnerabilities.
      </p>
