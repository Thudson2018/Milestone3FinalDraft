    <h1>Topic 1: History of the Browsers</h1>
    <p>
      Beginning in Geneva, Switzerland in the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN.)
      Tim Berners-Lee created the first Web server and browser and was initially called the
      “World Wide Web” later being called “Nexus.” This marked the beginning for future companies
      to create their own browsers, later giving us open-source browsers in 2004 with the release
      of FireFox by Modzilla. This sparked the competition to create other more polished open
      source browsers such as Google releasing “Chromium” now known as “Chrome” that was praised
      for its ease of use and faster speeds. But with Apple running on another operating system 
      called “MacOS” and “IOS” led to them creating their own browser called “Safari in 2003” 
      optimized for their own unique operating systems.

    <h2>What is OS?</h2>
    <p>
      The OS or "Operating System" is the foundation for bridging the gap between user and hardwear. 
      If the CPU is the Brain of the computer then the OS would be nevervous system. The OS system is 
      what all the hardwear uses to communcate with each other in order to work properly.

      <h3>Key Concept</h3>
      <p>
        Differnt Operating systems are designed and made most efficent for differnt hardware.
        Though you can use either browser on both they are optimized to run on their own OS.
      </p>

    <h2>Innovations in Browsers</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the decades of hardwork and innovation there have been major yet unnoticed changes that
      streamlined the entire game of Browsers. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tab Browsing: </strong> Allow's user's to interact with multiple tab's at once</li>
      <li><strong>Extentions:</strong> Enhances the overall experience and capability of browsers</li>
      <li><strong>Secruity:</strong> Ensured saftey and privacy for all user's on the internet</li>
