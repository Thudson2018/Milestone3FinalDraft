# Milestone3FinalDraft
Through this I have learned more than any other coding class I have takin part of. We learned all of the bones for this but being able to test what you know and your overall problem solving with this has been INVALUABLE. Trying to create more complicated programs is fun but having the active feedback of commiting changes to a website has been one of the most fun and frustrating experiences.

I had ALOT of issues going into this, mostly with my github desktop that I would work on and my account not properly working together. so after creating a handful of repositories on 3 differnt devices I was able to sit down with a family friend and he helped me catch alot of mistakes and simplfy alot of my work and make it look better than it did between Milestone 1 and 2. For Milestone 3 he helped me with the use of JavaScript and the quiz section because I wanted to learn more about the multiple choice options.
