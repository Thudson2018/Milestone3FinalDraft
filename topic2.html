    <h1>Topic 2: Future of Browsers </h1>
    <p>
      The future of where innovation will bring us is unpredictable. But non-negotiable 
      advancements of the future are easy to guess. With the constantly evolving world of hacking
      and scams, an increase of user security is something we are bound to see in the future. 
      The integration of AI into browsers will increase as well in the future. We have already 
      seen small test examples such as "AI overview" on chrome, these constant small steps
      will contiune with the more we learn about AI and the usefulness. We can also expect less 
      demanding requirements as we increase the overall efficenty of browsers as well make it 
      easier for smaller devices be fully accessable to the web. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Most popular browsers: </h2>
    <p>
      Even though they all do the same job there are without a doubt giants that dominate 
      the field of Browsers. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> With well over half the user's of the internet Chrome is
        responsible for Sixty Eight percent of browser users. This is for a multitude of reasons
        including their stream lined and easy user interface not only with the browser but their
        full suite of app's and extentions including Gmail, Google Drive, and Slides.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Safari:</strong> 
        Safari is the second largest host with eighteen percent of browser users. This is 
        due to apple products coming with safari as a default browser that many do not change. 
      </li>
      <li><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> The remaining twelve percent of user's are on various other 
        browsers such as Edge, FireFox, and others. Differnt browsers attract differnt audiences and often
        times these user's are on the default browser for their devices, or prefer the marketed security of browsers
        like FireFox. 
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      There is a constant search for the next advacement's for browsers. The next steps at the moment are 
      nearly unheard of but will become more apparent as technology and studies advance over time. What is 
      unthought of now will be a given in a few years just like the addition of tab's, or Security requirments 
      all browser's are required to meet.
