    <h1>Introduction, History, and Future of Browsers</h1>
    <p>
      Web browsers are the main interface in which users interact with the World
      Wide Web. It is what displays, processes, and interacts with the digital world 
      connecting every person to one another in the vast sea of online information 
      out there. There is a deep historical conversation to be had about the 
      “Browser” as well as in depth conversations to be had over the current and 
      future state of where and how the browser we know will fade in the unending 
      evolution of the internet. 
    </p>
    <h2>Role of the Browser?</h2>
    <p>
      The role of the browser is to connect our various devices to the online sea 
      of information. It connects, retrieves, and displays the desired topic and 
      websites the user wants to connect with. These various websites often involve
      HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other languages. They sort through these
      different languages and process them so that the user can interact with the
      pages. While this is happening often, the browser is taking note of things such
      as cookies, securities, and supporting the World Wide Web standards given by 
      the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C.)
